# Salesforce Change User Story Risk Calculator

This project is a small exercise aimed at exploring the theoretical calculation of the overall risk associated with a user story for a change being made to Salesforce. The calculation is based on assessing the individual risk levels of the metadata components related to that user story. The primary purpose of this project is to practice algorithm design, web application development, and to strengthen my JavaScript skills.

## Project Overview

In software development, especially in projects involving Salesforce, assessing and managing the risk associated with changes is crucial. This project delves into the concept of quantifying risk by considering the risk levels of the individual metadata components that contribute to a change user story. It's important to note that this project is designed for my personal learning and practice purposes and is not intended for open-source use.

## Features

- Calculate the risk level of changing an individual piece of metadata based on it's attributes.
- Calculate the overall risk of a Salesforce change user story based on the aggregated risk levels of related metadata components.

## Usage

This project is meant for my own personal learning and experimentation. To use the risk calculator, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project files in your preferred text editor or integrated development environment.
3. Explore the codebase to understand how the risk calculation is implemented.
4. Modify and experiment with the metadata inputs to explore how they impact the risk outcome.
